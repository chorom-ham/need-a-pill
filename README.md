# Need a pill:pill:
<p>방한 외국인을 위한 비상약 정보 제공 모바일웹
<p>Needapill is a service for foreigners residing in Korea who are in need of medicinal information.

<p>We are a team of Korean university students based in Seoul, the capital city. 
<p>We've seen many instances where exchange students had trouble communicating which medicine they should take, or figuring out what it was for even if they had one.
<p>We've empathized strongly with this problem, and our team has vigorously worked to provide the necessary service dedicated to solving it. 
<p>And as a result, the mobile website <b>NEED A PILL</B> is out!
